# Personnal AI Project

This project aims to explore and experiment with various tools in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically:

*   [**LangChain**](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain): A Python library for creating chain of thought and give the llm acces to tools.
*   [**Ollama**](https://github.com/ollama/ollama): a Large Language Model manager.
*   [**Qdrant**](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant): An open-source vector database for storing, indexing, and retrieving large amounts of data.
*   [**Scikit-learn (sklearn)**](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn): A widely-used machine learning library for Python that provides efficient algorithms for various tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, etc.
*   [**Crew.ai**](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI): Multi-agent librarty to tackle complex task. 
*   [**Petals**](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/petals): An open-source AI development framework that enables building and deploying large language models at home, BitTorrent-style. 

## Goals

The primary goal of this project is to automate various tasks using these new tools. Some potential areas for exploration include:

- Create an RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) capable of retrieving information from both local files and the web.
- Develop complex chain of thought workflows using multiple AI agents, each with their own roles.
- Explore the possibility of creating an automatic coder with human confirmation and inputs.
- Control a robot in ROS Gazebo using an LLM (e.g., for voice control or accessing external resources).
- Integrate the project with personal knowledge management tools like Obsidian and Nextcloud.
